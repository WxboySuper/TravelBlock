# Contributing to TravelBlock

Thanks for considering contributing! A few guidelines to make contributions smooth:

- Use TypeScript for new files and follow existing project patterns.
- Run `npm run lint` and fix issues before submitting a PR.
- Include tests for new features when appropriate.
- Link related issues in the PR description (use `Fixes #<issue>` when closing an issue).
- Keep PRs focused and small; one logical change per PR.

Process

- Fork the repo and create a branch named `feat/` or `fix/`.
- Open a PR against `main` and use the PR template.
- Assign reviewers and respond to feedback.

Thank you — your contributions are welcome!
