PR Title Style Guide (repository-customized)

Purpose: keep PR titles consistent, machine-readable, and easy to scan in changelogs.

Format: `<type>(<scope>): <short description>`

- `type` (semantic keyword): `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `chore`, `ci`, `build`, `revert`.
- `scope` (optional): short area of the codebase — use one of the repository scopes below to make review/triage easier.
- `short description`: imperative, present-tense, <= 50 characters where possible.

Recommended repository scopes (pick the most specific):
- `app` — top-level app routing and layouts (`app/` files, Expo Router)
- `components` — reusable UI components in `components/`
- `ui` — UI primitives under `components/ui` (IconSymbol, Collapsible, etc.)
- `screens` — screen-level code inside `app/` and `(tabs)`
- `hooks` — custom hooks in `hooks/` (theme, color scheme)
- `assets` — static assets and fonts (`assets/`)
- `data` — local datasets (airports.json, fixtures) and parsing utilities
- `flight-engine` — core simulation logic (timer, distance mapping, cockpit)
- `maps` — map visualization and map-related integrations (`react-native-maps`)
- `audio` — audio assets and playback (seatbelt chime, landing sounds)
- `navigation` — navigation/routing concerns (expo-router, links)
- `expo` — Expo config, modules, and SDK usage (app.json, manifest)
- `eas` — EAS build workflows and `.eas/workflows` configs
- `scripts` — tooling and utility scripts in `scripts/`
- `github` — GitHub automation, templates and workflows (`.github/`)
- `tests` — test infra, snapshots, and CI test config
- `ci` — CI / linters / formatters / workflows
- `deps` — dependency upgrades (package.json / podfile changes)

Examples:
- `feat(api): add project search endpoint (#789)`
- `fix(auth): prevent duplicate session creation`
- `chore(deps): upgrade flask to 3.0`

Best practices (brief):
- Keep the title focused and short; expand details in the PR body.
- Mention related issue IDs in the title only when helpful; prefer `Fixes #123` in the PR body.
- Use the `scope` to route reviewers (e.g., `frontend`, `backend`, `infra`).

## Summary
<!-- Provide a short, clear summary of what this pull request changes and why. Keep it to 1-3 sentences.

See the PR Title Style Guide above for recommended title/keyword formatting. -->

## Related issues
<!--
Reference related issues using keywords like `Fixes #123` or `Closes #123` when applicable.

Best practices:
- Use `Fixes #<number>` to automatically close issues when the PR is merged.
- If multiple issues are related, list them and explain the relationship briefly.
- Note any dependency ordering (e.g. "merge after #123").
-->

## What changed
<!--
List the concrete changes made in this PR. Use short bullets and include file/feature names when helpful.

Best practices / what to include:
- Files & areas changed: `backend/models.py: fix validation`
- DB/migration notes: schema changes, data migrations, downstream impacts
- Performance/security considerations and any feature flags used
- Backwards-incompatible changes and necessary follow-up steps
-->

## Screenshots / Recordings (if applicable)
<!--
Add images or short recordings that demonstrate UI changes or important behavior differences.

Best practices:
- Prefer small, focused screenshots with brief captions. For recordings, keep them under 30s.
- Provide context: which route/flow, steps to reproduce the screenshot, and expected vs actual.
- Include accessible alt text for images.
-->

## Testing performed
<!--
Describe what you did to verify the change works. Keep this brief and actionable.

Best practices:
- List specific commands and steps used to test (example commands are helpful). Example: `pytest tests/test_models.py -k create`.
- Indicate whether CI passes locally or on remote, and which test suites were run.
- Note any manual test scenarios and edge cases verified.
-->

- Tested locally:
- Unit/integration tests added:

### Test configuration
<!--
Provide environment details so reviewers can reproduce tests:
- Browsers (if frontend) and versions
- OS and version
- Python/Node versions and major deps (e.g. `Python 3.11`, `Node 18`)
- Any env vars or feature flags required to run tests
-->

## Checklist (please complete before merging)
<!-- Checklist best practices:
- Only check items you have completed; don't use these boxes as selectors for PR type.
- If a checklist item requires a link (e.g. test run, CI), add it in "Testing performed" or "Additional notes".

These are interactive checkboxes and are intended as a true pre-merge checklist — keep them as checkboxes.

## Additional notes
<!--
Any other context, deployment notes, or caveats reviewers should know about.
